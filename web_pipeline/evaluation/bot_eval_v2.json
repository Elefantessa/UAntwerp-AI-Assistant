    "question": "What are the admission requirements for the Master in Computer Science: Data Science and AI?",
    "gold_answer": "The admission board looks at both academic and programme‑specific requirements. Your bachelor’s degree must be comparable to the University of Antwerp’s BSc in Computer Science. Applicants with degrees in computer science, artificial intelligence or related programmes from universities comparable to Belgian universities are eligible. During the programme‑specific assessment the board checks your background in object‑oriented software development, mathematics (discrete mathematics, linear algebra, calculus, statistics) and theoretical computer science (data structures, algorithm analysis and complexity). You must complete a prescreening form and provide transcripts. Because the programme is taught in English, applicants from outside Flanders must submit an accepted English‑language certificate."
