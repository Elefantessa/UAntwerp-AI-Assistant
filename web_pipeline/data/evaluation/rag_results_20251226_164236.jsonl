Make sure to complete it rigorously and honestly. Based on your transcripts and the pre-screening form, the Board of Admissions checks if there is a good match of the topics covered by your Bachelor's program and our Bachelor's in Computer Science. The subjects are grouped into \"Computer skills\", \"math skills\", \"theoretical computer science\", \"databases\", \"software engineering\", and \"computer networks\". The board’s flexibility on which of these groups are not covered by courses you have taken is very limited. Also, self-study is only taken into account as reinforcement in a group where insufficiently many courses are listed, not as a replacement.\n\n3.      Language requirements\n\n3.      Language requirements\n\nThe programme is taught in English and an academic level of proficiency in this language is imperative.\n\nCandidates with a bachelor degree from universities outside Flanders are required to demonstrate their English language skills in by submitting one of the language certificates listed [here](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/study/admission-and-enrolment/admission/master-and-advanced-master/admission-requirements/).", "Title: Admission and enrolment | Master of Computer Science: Data Science and Artificial Intelligence | University of Antwerp | Program: DS | Page Type: admission-and-enrolment\n\nFirst, check if you meet the admission requirements to ensure that you are eligible to start the programme.\n\nIf you meet these requirements, you can proceed with the application.", "Title: Application | Master of Computer Science: Data Science and Artificial Intelligence | University of Antwerp | Program: DS | Page Type: admission-and-enrolment\n\n# Bachelor's degree from the Benelux and you do not have to apply for a visa?\n\nIf you have a bachelor's degree from a higher education institution IN Belgium, the Netherlands or Luxembourg that grants direct admission AND you are not required to have a visa, you don’t need to proceed via Mobility Online.\n\nIf you have a bachelor's degree from a higher education institution IN Belgium, the Netherlands or Luxembourg that does not grant direct admission AND you are not required to have a visa, you will have to apply for [permission](https://studhelp.uantwerpen.be/wetenschappen/knowledgebase.php?article=121) from the faculty.

This comprises:\n\n- modelling and simulation of scientific phenomena (e.g. the human genome project, weather prediction)\n- interactions between parts of complex machines (e.g. automotive, medical devices)\n- understanding the foundations of computer science (e.g. search engines, programming languages, network protocols)\n\nAs in all scientific disciplines such models allow us to understand and control our environment, as such allowing us to make predictions about what will happen in critical situations.\n\nThe master programme culminates in the master's thesis. The aim of this thesis is for you to show that you are able to (under supervision of a promoter) explore independently a complex subject in a scientific manner and write down the acquired insight into a coherent text.\n\n# Practice in your programme\n\nA computer scientist with academic training should be capable of applying the knowledge and skills acquired through the programme in concrete day-to-day situations. Consequently there is ample room for practical work and - not surprisingly - group work. Former graduates informed us that independence and maturity are strengths of programme.\n\nBesides project work, there is also time for experiments and exercises in the computer lab. We have the necessary technical infrastructure and ensure that it keeps pace with the natural evolution in the field.\n\n# Laptop profile\n\nWe expect students to bring a regular laptop running Linux and/or Windows (MacOS often suffices, but support may be limited).

However, without further information from the university, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer.\n\nReferences:\n[1] https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/study/programmes/all-programmes/master-software-engineering/study-programme/\n[2] https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/study/programmes/all-programmes/master-software-engineering/study-programme/?id=2025-2600WETCOO&lang=en\n[3] https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/study/programmes/all-programmes/master-software-engineering/study-programme/?id=2025-2600WETNOO&lang=en", "contexts": ["Title: Study programme | Master of Computer Science: Software Engineering | University of Antwerp | Program: SE | Page Type: study-programme\n\n## [Convex Analysis and Optimization](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/study/programmes/all-programmes/master-software-engineering/study-programme/?id=2025-2600WETCOO&lang=en)\n\n- **Course code:** 2600WETCOO\n- **Semester:** 2E SEM\n- **Contact hours:** 60\n- **ECTS-credits:** 6 ECTS-credits\n- **Study load (hours):** 168\n- **Contract restrictions:** No contract restriction\n- **Language of instruction:** English\n- **Bi-annual course:** Taught in academic years starting in an even year\n- **Exam Period:** exam in the 2nd semester\n- **Study domain:** Mathematics\n- **Lecturer(s):** Masoud Ahookhosh\n\n## [Nonsmooth optimisation](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/study/programmes/all-programmes/master-software-engineering/study-programme/?id=2025-2600WETNOO&lang=en)\n\n- **Course code:** 2600WETNOO\n- **Semester:** 2E SEM\n- **Contact hours:** 60\n- **ECTS-credits:** 6 ECTS-credits\n- **Study load (hours):** 168\n- **Contract restrictions:** No contract restriction\n- **Language of instruction:** English\n- **Bi-annual course:** Taught in academic years starting in an odd year\n- **Exam Period:** exam in the 2nd semester\n- **Study domain:** Mathematics\n- **Lecturer(s):** Masoud Ahookhosh", "Title: Programme info | Master of Computer Science: Software Engineering | University of Antwerp | Program: SE | Page Type: programme-info\n\n# Are you eligible to start the programme?\n\nMore information on admission and enrollment can be found on [this page.](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/study/programmes/all-programmes/master-software-engineering/admission-and-enrolment/)\n\n# Research in your programme\n\nThe common theme of the master programme is modelling as applied in all the subdisciplines of computer science. This comprises:\n\n- modelling and simulation of scientific phenomena (e.g. the human genome project, weather prediction)\n- interactions between parts of complex machines (e.g. automotive, medical devices)\n- understanding the foundations of computer science (e.g. search engines, programming languages, network protocols)\n\nAs in all scientific disciplines such models allow us to understand and control our environment, as such allowing us to make predictions about what will happen in critical situations.\n\nThe master programme culminates in the master's thesis. The aim of this thesis is for you to show that you are able to (under supervision of a promoter) explore independently a complex subject in a scientific manner and write down the acquired insight into a coherent text.\n\n# Practice in your programme\n\nA computer scientist with academic training should be capable of applying the knowledge and skills acquired through the programme in concrete day-to-day situations. Consequently there is ample room for practical work and - not surprisingly - group work. Former graduates informed us that independence and maturity are strengths of programme.\n\nBesides project work, there is also time for experiments and exercises in the computer lab. We have the necessary technical infrastructure and ensure that it keeps pace with the natural evolution in the field.\n\n# Laptop profile\n\nWe expect students to bring a regular laptop running Linux and/or Windows (MacOS often suffices, but support may be limited). Operating system: Modern medium range GPU. University computing servers will be used for demanding computations."], "sources": ["https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/study/programmes/all-programmes/master-software-engineering/study-programme/", "https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/study/programmes/all-programmes/master-software-engineering/programme-info/"], "confidence": 0.7347679290473461, "ground_truth": "The programme covers various programming languages and software development practices.", "success": true}
