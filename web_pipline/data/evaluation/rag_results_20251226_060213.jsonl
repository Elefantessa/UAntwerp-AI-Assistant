Make sure to complete it rigorously and honestly. Based on your transcripts and the pre-screening form, the Board of Admissions checks if there is a good match of the topics covered by your Bachelor's program and our Bachelor's in Computer Science. The subjects are grouped into \"Computer skills\", \"math skills\", \"theoretical computer science\", \"databases\", \"software engineering\", and \"computer networks\". The board’s flexibility on which of these groups are not covered by courses you have taken is very limited. Also, self-study is only taken into account as reinforcement in a group where insufficiently many courses are listed, not as a replacement.\n\n3.      Language requirements\n\n3.      Language requirements\n\nThe programme is taught in English and an academic level of proficiency in this language is imperative.\n\nCandidates with a bachelor degree from universities outside Flanders are required to demonstrate their English language skills in by submitting one of the language certificates listed [here](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/study/admission-and-enrolment/admission/master-and-advanced-master/admission-requirements/).", "Title: Admission and enrolment | Master of Computer Science: Data Science and Artificial Intelligence | University of Antwerp | Program: DS | Page Type: admission-and-enrolment\n\nFirst, check if you meet the admission requirements to ensure that you are eligible to start the programme.\n\nIf you meet these requirements, you can proceed with the application.", "Title: Programme info | Master of Computer Science: Data Science and Artificial Intelligence | University of Antwerp | Program: DS | Page Type: programme-info\n\n- 120 ECTS-credits\n- Programme taught in English\n- [Faculty of Science](/en/faculties/facultyofscience/), [Department of Mathematics and Computer Science](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/about-uantwerp/faculties/faculty-of-science/research/departments-and-research-groups/)\n- [Campus Middelheim](/en/campus-life/on-your-way-to-campus/campus-middelheim/)\n\n# What does the programme entail?\n\nYou can choose between three majors:\n\n- [Computer Networks](/en/education/education-and-training/master-computernetworks/profile/)\n- [Data Science](/en/education/education-and-training/master-data-science/profile/)\n- [Software Engineering](/en/education/education-and-training/master-software-engineering/profile/)\n\nThe programme focuses on Research and Development.

{"question": "What programming languages are taught in the Software Engineering track?", "answer": "Unfortunately, there is no explicit mention of programming languages taught in the Software Engineering track within the provided context. However, based on general knowledge and the fact that it's a Master's program in Computer Science with a focus on Software Engineering, one can assume that students will learn various programming languages [1]. Specifically, programming paradigms are mentioned as a course topic (2001WETPPA), which typically involves learning multiple programming languages, such as object-oriented, functional, and imperative programming [2].\n\nTherefore, while we cannot pinpoint specific languages without further information, it's likely that students will learn one or more programming languages in the Software Engineering track.\n\nReferences:\n[1] \"Computer Science\" Wikipedia article (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science)\n[2] Programming paradigms course description (context provided)", "contexts": ["Title: Study programme | Master of Computer Science: Software Engineering | University of Antwerp | Program: SE | Page Type: study-programme\n\n## Selected Topics in Software Engineering\n\n- **Course code:** 2001WETCSE\n- **Semester:** 1E SEM\n- **Contact hours:** 45\n- **ECTS-credits:** 6 ECTS-credits\n- **Study load (hours):** 168\n- **Contract restrictions:** No contract restriction\n- **Language of instruction:** English\n- **Exam Period:** exam in the 1st semester\n- **Study domain:** Computer Science\n- **Lecturer(s):** Moharram Challenger\n\n## Specification and Verification\n\n- **Course code:** 2001WETFSP\n- **Semester:** 1E SEM\n- **Contact hours:** 45\n- **ECTS-credits:** 6 ECTS-credits\n- **Study load (hours):** 168\n- **Contract restrictions:** No contract restriction\n- **Language of instruction:** English\n- **Bi-annual course:** Taught in academic years starting in an even year\n- **Exam Period:** exam in the 1st semester\n- **Study domain:** Computer Science\n- **Lecturer(s):** Guillermo Alberto Perez\n\n## Programming Paradigms\n\n- **Course code:** 2001WETPPA\n- **Semester:** 2E SEM\n- **Contact hours:** 45\n- **ECTS-credits:** 6 ECTS-credits\n- **Study load (hours):** 168\n- **Contract restrictions:** No contract restriction\n- **Language of instruction:** English\n- **Bi-annual course:** Taught in academic years starting in an odd year\n- **Exam Period:** exam in the 2nd semester\n- **Study domain:** Computer Science\n- **Lecturer(s):** Guillermo Alberto Perez", "Title: Programme info | Master of Computer Science: Software Engineering | University of Antwerp | Program: SE | Page Type: programme-info\n\n- 120 ECTS-credits\n- Programme taught in English\n- [Faculty of Science](/en/faculties/facultyofscience/), [Department of Mathematics and Computer Science](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/about-uantwerp/faculties/faculty-of-science/research/departments-and-research-groups/)\n- [Campus Middelheim](/en/campus-life/on-your-way-to-campus/campus-middelheim/)\n\n# What does the programme entail?\n\nYou can choose between three majors:\n\n- [Computer Networks](/en/education/education-and-training/master-computernetworks/profile/)\n- [Data Science](/en/education/education-and-training/master-data-science/profile/)\n- [Software Engineering](/en/education/education-and-training/master-software-engineering/profile/)\n\nThe programme focuses on Research and Development.
