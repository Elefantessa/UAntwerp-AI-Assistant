      "markdown": "- 120 ECTS-credits\n- Programme taught in English\n- [Faculty of Science](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/faculties/facultyofscience/), [Department of Mathematics and Computer Science](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/about-uantwerp/faculties/faculty-of-science/research/departments-and-research-groups/)\n- [Campus Middelheim](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/campus-life/on-your-way-to-campus/campus-middelheim/)\n\n# What does the programme entail?\n\nYou can choose between three majors:\n\n- [Computer Networks](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/education/education-and-training/master-computernetworks/profile/)\n- [Data Science](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/education/education-and-training/master-data-science/profile/)\n- [Software Engineering](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/education/education-and-training/master-software-engineering/profile/)\n\nThe programme focuses on Research and Development. In contrast to the Dutch programme equivalent, there are no majors/minors such as Education or Management.\n\nThe two years are built out of 4 blocks:\n\n- Master thesis \"30 credits\" (compulsory)\n- Elective courses \"30 credits\"\n- General competences \"30 credits\" (compulsory)\n- Two research internships \"15 credits each\" (compulsory)\n\n[Download the programme structure](https://medialibrary.uantwerpen.be/oldcontent/container1991/files/MCS ProgrStruct2016-2017 OC20150513.pdf)\n\n# Are you eligible to start the programme?\n\nMore information on admission and enrollment can be found on [this page.](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/study/programmes/all-programmes/master-software-engineering/admission-and-enrolment/)\n\n# Research in your programme\n\nThe common theme of the master programme is modelling as applied in all the subdisciplines of computer science. This comprises:\n\n- modelling and simulation of scientific phenomena (e.g. the human genome project, weather prediction)\n- interactions between parts of complex machines (e.g. automotive, medical devices)\n- understanding the foundations of computer science (e.g. search engines, programming languages, network protocols)\n\nAs in all scientific disciplines such models allow us to understand and control our environment, as such allowing us to make predictions about what will happen in critical situations.\n\nThe master programme culminates in the master's thesis. The aim of this thesis is for you to show that you are able to (under supervision of a promoter) explore independently a complex subject in a scientific manner and write down the acquired insight into a coherent text.\n\n# Practice in your programme\n\nA computer scientist with academic training should be capable of applying the knowledge and skills acquired through the programme in concrete day-to-day situations. Consequently there is ample room for practical work and - not surprisingly - group work. Former graduates informed us that independence and maturity are strengths of programme.\n\nBesides project work, there is also time for experiments and exercises in the computer lab. We have the necessary technical infrastructure and ensure that it keeps pace with the natural evolution in the field.\n\n# Laptop profile\n\nWe expect students to bring a regular laptop running Linux and/or Windows (MacOS often suffices, but support may be limited). Operating system: Modern medium range GPU. University computing servers will be used for demanding computations.\n",

The review team found that students (and graduates) are very satisfied with the programme since there are short lines of communication with teachers, concerns of students are taken into account and the developed hard and soft skills are a good preparation for the professional field.\n\nTo better match the large influx of Belgian and international students, in the coming period the programme will, among other things, make the structure of the programme and its unique profile clearer in communication. Possible obstacles to mapping out one's own path in the wide range of choices in the master's programme will be investigated and, if possible, remedied.\n\nIn order to get better acquainted with companies, job events will be organised and the possibility of a company internship will be looked into. More opportunities for international experiences will also be pursued.\n\n[Read the entire public report](https://medialibrary.uantwerpen.be/files/51148/b481efd5-9ed1-4f31-9a1c-1e17dee10e19.pdf)\n\n# Facts and figures\n\nThe website '[opleiding in cijfers](https://www.vlaanderen.be/onderwijs-en-vorming/afgestudeerd-wat-nu/hulp-bij-je-studie-of-beroepskeuze/opleidingen-hoger-onderwijs-in-cijfers)' gives you more detailed information about alle programmes in Flemish university colleges and universities.\n",
